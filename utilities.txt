      "description": "React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started."

      "description": "If you're interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on CodePen, CodeSandbox, or Stackblitz.If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also download this HTML file, edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so we'd only recommend using this for simple demos."

Each of them can work with little to no configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich React ecosystem. Learn how."

It will take you between 30 minutes and an hour but you will feel more confident learning React."

The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any React apps, and mastering it will give you a much deeper understanding."

      [
        "Why use React instead of Javascript?",
        "Depending on the task, React can be helpfull when creating a large aplication with multiple components. React uses something called the virtual DOM (Document Object Model) a copy of the real DOM, and then only update the componends wich have been changed, in contrast to the entire DOM. This allows the rendering process to take less time and be efficient."
